# Work Orders System - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Feature**: Monthly Work Orders for Filter Deliveries
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete monthly work order system for managing bulk filter deliveries and presential maintenances. This feature addresses the client requirement to group maintenances by month and generate unified work orders for warehouse management and logistics (Blue Express).

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**New Models:**

- **WorkOrder** - Stores monthly work orders
  - Unique constraint: `(year, month, deliveryType)`
  - Status workflow: `DRAFT → GENERATED → CANCELLED`
  - Stores package and filter summaries as JSON
  - Tracks timestamps for creation, generation, and cancellation

- **WorkOrderFilterUsage** - Tracks inventory deductions
  - Links work orders to filters with quantities
  - Supports restoration when cancelled
  - Includes `restoredAt` timestamp for audit trail

**Schema Updates:**

- **Maintenance Model**:
  - Added `deliveryType` field (PRESENCIAL | DOMICILIO)
  - Added `workOrderId` foreign key
  - Existing 2,505 maintenances updated with deliveryType from Equipment
  - Indexes added for performance

**Files Changed:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `supabase/add-work-orders.sql` (manual migration)

---

### 2. API Endpoints ✅

**Work Order Management:**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/work-orders` | GET | List all work orders (with filters) |
| `/api/work-orders/generate` | POST | Generate new work order (DRAFT status) |
| `/api/work-orders/[id]` | GET | Get work order details |
| `/api/work-orders/[id]` | DELETE | Delete DRAFT work order |
| `/api/work-orders/[id]/confirm` | POST | Confirm work order (deduct inventory) |
| `/api/work-orders/[id]/cancel` | POST | Cancel work order (restore inventory) |

**Enhanced Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Enhancement |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/maintenances` | Added `deliveryType` filter parameter |

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Validates sufficient inventory before confirming
- ✅ Auto-calculates filter needs using existing forecast logic
- ✅ Groups by FilterPackage code ("2.1", "3.1", etc.)
- ✅ Restores inventory atomically on cancellation
- ✅ Prevents duplicate work orders for same period

---

### 3. User Interface ✅

**Work Orders List Page** (`/app/work-orders/page.tsx`)

Features:
- Grid view of all work orders
- Filters by status (DRAFT, GENERATED, CANCELLED)
- Filters by delivery type (Domicilio, Presencial)
- Stats dashboard showing counts
- "Generate New Order" modal with month/year/type selection
- Visual status badges with icons
- Package summary preview on cards

**Work Order Detail Page** (`/app/work-orders/[id]/page.tsx`)

Features:
- **Summary Section**:
  - Total maintenances count
  - Package types count
  - Filter types count

- **Package Summary**:
  - Human-readable format: "28 paquetes 2.1, 28 de 3.1, 12 de 4.1"
  - Visual grid showing package counts

- **Filter Breakdown**:
  - Individual filter quantities (e.g., "PP-10CF: 156 unidades")
  - Sorted by quantity (descending)

- **Client List**:
  - Full table with client details, addresses, plan codes
  - Sorted by comuna for logistics optimization
  - Shows scheduled maintenance dates

- **Inventory Deductions** (for GENERATED orders):
  - Shows which filters were deducted
  - Timestamps for deduction/restoration
  - Status indicators

- **Actions**:
  - **DRAFT**: Confirm or Delete
  - **GENERATED**: Cancel (restores inventory)
  - **All**: Export to PDF (print-friendly view)

**Print/PDF Export**:
- Optimized print stylesheet (hidden header, AMAWA branding)
- Professional layout for warehouse/logistics
- Browser's native "Print to PDF" functionality

---

### 4. Data Import Updates ✅

**File**: `scripts/import-extended-data.ts`

**Changes**:
- New maintenances now automatically get `deliveryType` from Excel column
- Uses `normalizeDeliveryType()` helper function
- Ensures data consistency from import forward

---

## Workflow

### Generating a Work Order

1. **User Action**: Click "Nueva Orden" → Select month, year, delivery type
2. **System**:
   - Finds all PENDING maintenances for that period
   - Groups by plan code and cycle to determine filter packages
   - Calculates package summary (e.g., `{"2.1": 28, "3.1": 28}`)
   - Calculates filter summary (e.g., `{"PP-10CF": 156}`)
   - Creates work order in DRAFT status
   - Links maintenances to work order

3. **Result**: Work order created, ready for review

### Confirming a Work Order

1. **User Action**: Click "Confirmar Orden" on DRAFT work order
2. **System**:
   - Validates sufficient inventory for all filters
   - Deducts inventory across locations (FIFO-like)
   - Creates `WorkOrderFilterUsage` records
   - Updates status to GENERATED
   - Sets `generatedAt` timestamp

3. **Result**: Inventory deducted, order locked

### Cancelling a Work Order

1. **User Action**: Click "Cancelar Orden" on GENERATED work order
2. **System**:
   - Restores inventory to primary location
   - Marks `WorkOrderFilterUsage` records as restored
   - Unlinks maintenances from work order
   - Updates status to CANCELLED
   - Sets `cancelledAt` timestamp

3. **Result**: Inventory restored, maintenances available for new work order

---

## Technical Highlights

### Smart Inventory Management

**Deduction Logic**:
```typescript
// Deducts from multiple locations until total quantity reached
for (const inventoryItem of filter.inventoryItems) {
  const deductAmount = Math.min(remainingToDeduct, inventoryItem.quantity)
  // Update inventory
  // Track in WorkOrderFilterUsage
}
```

**Restoration Logic**:
```typescript
// Restores to primary location (highest stock)
const primaryLocation = inventoryItems.sort((a, b) => b.quantity - a.quantity)[0]
```

### Package Summary Generation

Reuses existing forecast calculation from `/api/inventory`:

```typescript
// Maps maintenance cycle + plan code → filter package
const mapping = mappings.find(
  m => m.planCode === planCode && m.maintenanceCycle === cycleNum
)

// Aggregates package counts
packageCounts[packageCode] = (packageCounts[packageCode] || 0) + count
```

### Print-Friendly PDF

Uses CSS print media queries:

```css
@media print {
  .print\\:hidden { display: none; }
  .print\\:block { display: block; }
}
```

Browser's native print-to-PDF provides:
- No external dependencies
- High-quality output
- Instant generation
- Zero server load

ALTER TABLE maintenances DROP COLUMN work_order_id;
```

**Monitoring**:
- Check work order generation success rate
- Monitor inventory deduction accuracy
- Track cancellation/restoration logs

## Questions Answered

✅ **How to differentiate presencial vs domicilio?**
→ Added `deliveryType` field to Maintenance model, copied from Equipment

✅ **What format for package summary?**
→ Uses FilterPackage.code ("2.1", "3.1"), displayed as "28 paquetes 2.1, ..."

✅ **Should 15-day buffer affect work orders?**
→ No, work orders group strictly by month (1st to last day)

✅ **How to handle work order errors?**
→ Three-state workflow: DRAFT (reversible delete) → GENERATED (cancellable) → CANCELLED

✅ **How to restore inventory after cancellation?**
→ Automatic restoration to primary location, tracked in `restoredAt` timestamp
